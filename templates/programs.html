        <h3>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h3>
        <p>Women, especially poor women in rural areas, remain the invisible 
backbone of their households and communities. However, their many 
disadvantages - poor education, limited opportunities for skills 
training, few property rights, and restrictive social norms - mean low
paying labour work is often their only option. Whatever they earn is 
almost always spent on improving the quality of life of their families.<br>
Our program aims to provide these women with opportunities to earn 
independent incomes, helping to strengthen their position as decision
makers in their families and in their communities. There is a special 
focus on ultra-poor women - those living in extreme poverty that are 
the only earning members of their families and have no assets or 
regular incomes.</p>
